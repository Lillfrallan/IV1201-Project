<h2><samp>Recruitment Application</samp></h2>
<h3><samp>⇁ Overview</samp></h3>

<p><samp>This project aims to develop a web-based recruitment application for an amusement park. The current system suffers from instability and unresolved bugs, leading to significant maintenance costs. As the original developers are no longer available, there's a need to rebuild a robust and scalable system that can efficiently handle the recruitment process.</samp></p>


<h3><samp>⇁ Background</samp></h3>

<p><samp>The amusement park is gearing up for the upcoming season and expects around 15,000 applications within a two-week period. The existing application, while functional, lacks stability and has unresolved bugs. Consultants have been brought in to fix these issues, but the company recognizes the need for a new, upgraded system that can accommodate future requirements.</samp></p>


<h3><samp>⇁ System Overview</samp></h3>

<p><samp>The recruitment system serves two main user roles: applicants and recruiters. Applicants can register and submit job applications, while recruiters manage and review these applications. The system is divided into two main parts: the registration of job applications and the administration of applications.</samp></p>
<h3><samp>⇁ Tools</samp></h3>

<p><samp>-Version control (Git)
-Project management (Maven)
-Cloud runtime (Heroku)</samp></p>

<h3><samp>⇁ Frameworks</samp></h3>

<p><samp>-Spring core technologies, in particular the IoC container
-Spring Boot
-Spring Web MVC
-Thymeleaf
-Spring Data (Commons and JPA)</samp></p>
<h4><samp>Registration of Applications</samp></h4>

<p><samp>Applicants provide personal information, a competence profile, and availability using a web browser. Future functionality includes multilingual support for the application form.</samp></p>

<h4><samp>Administration of Job Applications</samp></h4>

<p><samp>Recruiters, employees of the company, can sort, accept, reject, or leave applications unhandled. Future enhancements include a mobile app for recruiters and an intelligent application selection system.</samp></p>

<h4>Existing Database Model</h4>

<p><samp>While the current system has an undocumented database, the data must be transferred to the new system without loss. A SQL script is available to generate the existing database.</samp></p>

<h4>Additional Requirements</h4>

<p><samp>The company has specific requirements for the new system, including comprehensive logging, cross-browser compatibility, and a smooth handover process. The system should be live on the cloud and easily modifiable by the company's IT developers. Additionally, provisions must be made for future development of a mobile application.</samp></p>

<h3><samp>⇁ Use Cases</samp></h3>

<p><samp>The project includes detailed use cases for creating accounts, logging in, applying for positions, listing applications, and viewing application details.</samp></p>

<p><samp><b>Note:</b> The project prioritizes addressing the tasks outlined in a provided document. While additional functionality is desirable, the primary goal is to deliver a stable, functional system within the given timeframe.</samp></p>
